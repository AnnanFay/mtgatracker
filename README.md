# MTGA Tracker
MTGA Tracker is an electron-based app that helps you track your MTGA decks!

## I'm not reading anything else until you tell me how to use it

I figured as much.

### Run from source

Make sure you have all of the following installed:
- [python3.6+](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
- [node.js / npm](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)
- (optional, but recommended) [Git Bash](https://git-scm.com/downloads)

Note that if you choose to skip Git Bash, you're on your own w.r.t. formatting shell commands.

1. Open Git Bash
1. Make sure python is installed by typing: `python --version` . You should see:
    ```bash
    you@yourmachine MINGW64 ~
    $ python --version
    Python 3.6.4
    ```
1. Make sure npm is installed by typing: `npm --version` .  You should see:
    ```bash
    you@yourmachine MINGW64 ~
    $ npm --version
    5.6.0
    ```
1. Run these commands # TODO: verify this
    ```bash
    cd /c/path/where/you/want/the/code
    git clone https://github.com/shawkinsl/mtga-tracker.git
    cd mtga-tracker
    # next 4 lines """optional"""
    python -m ensurepip
    pip install virtualenv --user
    python -m virtualenv venv
    source venv/Scripts/activate
    # read more about virtualenv here: http://www.pythonforbeginners.com/basics/how-to-use-python-virtualenv
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    cd electron
    npm install .
    ```
1. If all went well, you should now be able to:
    ```bash
    ./node_modules/.bin/electron .
    ```
    And the decktracker UI should launch!
    
### Building

Building from windows? Try `sh build.sh` . If that doesn't work, get in touch with @shawkinsl to figure it out.

Output will end up in `MTGATracker-<os>-<arch>` .

Building is probably not supported on OSX yet. (But then again, neither is MTGA, so what are you even doing?)

## Docs

### Native App
**Backend**

The back end is at it's core a python log parser project. There's a websockets app tacked on top to communicate state with
the frontend.

**Front end**

The front end of MTGA Tracker is an electron app that uses node / websocket to communicate with the backend

### Project layout

`app` - python backend for watching MTGA logs

`electron` - native electron app

`scripts` - various scripts and utilities. either one-time use, or just don't really fit anywhere

`webtasks` - node.js / webtask.io code for webapp and app to talk to

`webapp` - code for mtga-tracker.com

It is entirely possible that Wizards of the Coast will disable all logging and completely wreck this project. While 
we certainly do not hope this will happen, it is worth noting that this project may stop working at any time. In the
event that this happens, please verify that what you are experiencing is a software issue, and if it is not, let
Wizards know you are sad the project was killed, via Reddit, Twitter, you name it. If you would like to be proactive,
