our [current projects](https://github.com/shawkinsl/mtga-tracker/projects), or our [code climate smells / issues](https://codeclimate.com/github/shawkinsl/mtga-tracker/issues).

and/or following / subscribing to
[our core contributors](https://github.com/shawkinsl/mtga-tracker/blob/master/contributors/core.yml) to keep us
motivated to keep working on this :)

## Contribution workflow

1. Create an issue for your changes. (Skip this step if changes are trivial).
1. Create a fork (or branch, if collaborator+)
1. Make your changes
    - If you created an issue, reference it in your commit (see: [github docs](https://help.github.com/articles/closing-issues-using-keywords/))
1. Create a pull request
    - All checks ~~and tests~~ (see: [#41](https://github.com/shawkinsl/mtga-tracker/issues/41), [#42](https://github.com/shawkinsl/mtga-tracker/issues/41)) must pass

- Have merged 10+ approved pull requests (with or without work needed)

- Have approval from at least one other core-contributor

#### Collaborators

pull requests, but a Collaborator's approval is not sufficient to merge into master without a core-contributor's
approval. Collaborators must meet one of the following criteria:

- Have merged 1+ approved pull request with no work needed
- Have merged 3+ approved pull requests (with or without work needed)
- Have contributed actionable input in 3+ approved pull requests
