# Contribution

## Contribution workflow

1. Create an issue for your changes. (Skip this step if changes are trivial).
1. Create a fork (or branch, if collaborator+)
1. Make your changes
    - If you created an issue, or are resolving an existing issue, reference it in your commit (see: [github docs](https://help.github.com/articles/closing-issues-using-keywords/))
1. Create a pull request
    - All checks ~~and tests~~ (see: [#41](https://github.com/shawkinsl/mtga-tracker/issues/41), [#42](https://github.com/shawkinsl/mtga-tracker/issues/41)) must pass

#### Core contributors

Core contributors are allowed to approve pull requests into master + collaborator permissions.
Core contributors must meet one of the following criteria:

- Have merged 3+ approved pull requests with no work needed
- Have merged 10+ approved pull requests (with or without work needed)
- Have contributed actionable input in 10+ approved pull requests
- Have merged 300+ total LOC changed
- Have made significant contributions otherwise (at the discretion of other core contributors)

And must meet all of the following criteria:

- Have been active in at least 1 code review / pull request in the last year
- Have approval from at least one other core-contributor

#### Collaborators

Collaborators are allowed to make branches directly within the mtga-tracker repo. They are encouraged to participate in
pull requests, but a Collaborator's approval is not sufficient to merge into master without a core-contributor's
approval. Collaborators must meet one of the following criteria:

- Have merged 1+ approved pull request with no work needed
- Have merged 3+ approved pull requests (with or without work needed)
- Have contributed actionable input in 3+ approved pull requests
- Have merged 50+ LOC total LOC changed
- Have made contributions otherwise (at the discretion of core contributors)

And must meet all of the following criteria:

- Have been active in at least 1 code review / pull request in the last year
- Have approval from at least one other collaborator
